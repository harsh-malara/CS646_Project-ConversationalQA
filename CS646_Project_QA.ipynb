            "['Traditional Differences Between Genre and Literary Fiction. The traditional differences between genre and literary fiction are outlined in the table below. Keep in mind these are broad-brush differences that in some cases focus on the extremes of the categories and that disagreements abound. Many genre books have elements of literary fiction and vice versa and there is increasingly a third category of crossover fiction that will be discussed below.', 'Literary Devices, Elements, Techniques, and Terms. A literary devise is any tool used in literature to help the reader understand the story and its character(s). There are two types of literary devises used by authors, literary elements and literary techniques. Literary elements. provide structure to the literature. All literary elements are evident in all literature that creates a story. Literary techniques. are specific to each author.', 'Bourdieu\\'s principle of habitus is interwoven with the concept of structuralism in literary theory. Peter Barry explains, \"in the structuralist approach to literature there is a constant movement away from interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger structures which contain them\" (2009, p. 39). There is therefore a strong desire to understand the larger influencing factors which makes an individual literary work. As Bourdieu explains, habitus \"are structured structures, generative principles of distinct and distinctive practices â€“ what the worker eats, and especially the way he eats it, the sport he practices and the way he practices it, his political opinions and the way he expresses them are systematically different from the industrial proprietor\\'s corresponding activities / habitus are also structuring structures, different classifying schemes classification principles, different principles of vision and division, different tastes. Habitus make different differences; they implement distinctions between what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong, between what is distinguished and what is vulgar, and so on, but they are not the same. Thus, for instance, the same behaviour or even the same good can appear distinguished to one person, pretentious to someone else, and cheap or showy to yet another\" (Bourdieu, 1996). As a result, habitus may be employed in literary theory in order to understand those larger, external structures which influence individual theories and works of literature.', 'We will explore the difference between literary elements and literary techniques, and look at examples and definitions of several popular literary terms.

The latter is considerably more conservative and is the language used in Welsh translations of the Bible, amongst other things (although the 2004 Beibl Cymraeg Newydd â€“ New Welsh Bible â€“ is significantly less formal than the traditional 1588 Bible).  Gareth King, author of a popular Welsh grammar, observes that \"The difference between these two is much greater than between the virtually identical colloquial and literary forms of English\". A grammar of Literary Welsh can be found in A Grammar of Welsh (1980) by Stephen J. Williams or more completely in Gramadeg y Gymraeg (1996) by Peter Wynn Thomas. (No comprehensive grammar of formal literary Welsh exists in English.)  An English-language guide to colloquial Welsh forms and register and dialect differences is \"Dweud Eich Dweud\" (2001, 2013) by Ceri Williams.', \"The setting of tone allows the reader to feel what the rest of the play will mostly be about.

            "[CLS] why is nominal gdp not a good measure? [SEP] comparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of nominal gdp and savings ( not just income ), which don't reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries ( see list of countries by gdp ( nominal ) per capita ) ; hence, using a ppp basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between nations because ppp takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income. this is why gdp ( ppp ) per capita is often considered one of the indicators of a country's standard of living, although this can be problematic because gdp per capita is not a measure of personal income\n",

            "[CLS] what are some important modern uses of allegory? [SEP] modern science can illuminate how and why people respond in certain ways to food plating and presentation. according to a sociological study people react differently to various aesthetic principles such as color, composition ( including number of components, placement of components, and use of negative space ), design, and the organization of a plate. they found that participants responded best to plates with four different colors, three different components, some empty space, and with a disorganized and casual design. this research is particularly important because understanding how food presentation affects how people eat can be used used in the study of health and nutrition. for instance, another study showed that participants who ate off of uncleaned tables ( i. e all uneaten food was left on the table ) ate less than those that had their tabled periodically cleaned. this is presumably because those that could see the leftovers of what they had eaten were less likely to take more food. this could be useful, for instance, in combatting the obesity endemic. another example of science in food aesthetics is the development of molecular food in spain, which emphasizes the essence of food using scientific elements. molecular science can break down the roles of carbohydrates and protein in order to isolate what creates particular tastes. for instance, modern science makes it possible to freeze ice cream using liquid nitrogen and create wine using sugars, creating efficient and visually interesting new dishes\n",
